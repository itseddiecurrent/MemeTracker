### Building Instruction
We have a dataset called "100line.txt" which is used as the parameter on line 48 of main.cpp. 
You can also download your prefered dataset from http://snap.stanford.edu/data/memetracker9.html, 
and upload it to the corresponding directory in order to execute the main.cpp. Change the "100line.txt" 
on line 48 in main.cpp to the name of your chosen dataset before you run the executable.
### Command:
Once you have uploaded the dataset, run `make finalProj` in the terminal 
and then run `./finalProj`.
